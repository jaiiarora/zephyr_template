board directory works fine
soc is causing error

 soc/arm/samsung/Kconfig.defconfig:7
arch/arm/soc/samsung/*/Kconfig.defconfig.series' not found (in 'source "arch/arm/soc/samsung/*/Kconfig.defconfig.series"'). Check that environment variables are set correctly (e.g. $srctree, which is set to '/home/airj23/zephyrproject/zephyr'). Also note that unset environment variables expand to the empty string.
